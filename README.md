# hello-world
First repository to get acquainted with GitHub

Hello there.

This is my first time using GitHub besides reading about some tips for a programming course or looking at commits for a blockchain project.

I am here today because I am planning to get a little bit more into coding again. Specifically, Ryan and I are going to analyze crypto currency data sets using R.


I am very excited!

I love the idea of GitHub and was gonna pitch it to GA in an interview, but MSFT bought it lmao.
